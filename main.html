          <p>
            Create a working drone from scratch. The second phase goal is to
            create a charging station that enables wireless charging. The third
            phase goal is optimizing the drone /adding more practical features
            to the drone. With this, we aim to create a drone that has
            multipurpose, particularly indoors, including FPV, self-charging,
            patrolling, etc.
